# UniMaps-Year2-Project
This was a project that I was the lead programmer for in my second year of university.
The project was to create a website that could direct new students or parents from their current locations to what ever building they were trying to get to.
The project uses PHP and SQL to store and use the buildings longtitude and latitude data. 
I used google maps api to display the directions to the user.
