# UniMaps-Year2-Project
 This is a project for year two at univeristy I was tasked as a part of a team to create an application that does something. My idea was a map that would show you the way around the university campus. I was set the task of programming the application. This uses PHP and PHPMyAdmin. Authentication key has been removed and a new one must be inserted.
